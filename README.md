# Quotes

Quotes angular Project was developed at Moringa school coding classes to further understanding of Angular.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.
The application has hard coded a number of quotes as a start. Users are allowed to add and remove quotes to suit their preferences.
Users can also like, upvote or downvote quotes to express their reaction to a quote.

## Development server

The following technology has been used to develop this application:

1. Node JS ver 14.X
2. Angular ver 9
3. Bootstrap ver 4
4. Fontawesome

To improve on the application, clone to your local machine and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
